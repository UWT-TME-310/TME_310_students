# Project Part 1 - group coordination

Your project groups have been assigned - you can see your group number and fellow team members by looking at the People page on Canvas.

The task for Part 1 of the course project is simple:

1. Find a time (using in-class time is encouraged!) to meet with your group and introduce yourselves to each other if you don't already know one another.
2. Decide amongst yourselves how your group will communicate and how often you plan to meet to work on the project for the rest of the quarter.
3. Write down what your group decided about communication and meeting frequency in the [Canvas assignment text box](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1835208/assignments/10692178).
