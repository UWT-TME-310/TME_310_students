# Accessibility and Accommodations

In addition to services offered by UW Tacoma's Disability Resources for Students (DRS), I will attempt to make every effort to adjust assignments/materials to meet the needs of students who need alternative forms of access.

If you find yourself in need of additional assistance, please feel free to contact me directly or arrange to attend my virtual office hours.
