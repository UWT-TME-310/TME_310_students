## Group project work

Ways your project groups can collaborate successfully:

* Use "branches"
  * This is the "right" way, but it assumes everyone knows how to pull, push, and merge changes.
* Take turns
  * This is safest, but it may slow your progress
* Copy/paste
  * This is fast and safe for git, but may cause Python errors (easier to resolve than git erros)


## Use branches

* Each member can start their own branch
* Frequently pull, push, and merge back to `origin/main`
* Copilot can help

## Take turns

* Huddle around one computer
* Only open one codespace at a time
* Commit and push after every change

## Copy/paste

* Work on things in your playground repo
* Talk about what code or text needs to be copied from each group member and pasted into the assignment repo.
* Paste everything in and confirm that it works when put together.

## Which to use?

* Decide within your group.
* Make use of "office hours"
