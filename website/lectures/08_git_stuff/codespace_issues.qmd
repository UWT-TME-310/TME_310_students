## Codespace and Git issues

* Some students have been experiencing issues with Git and GitHub codespaces.
* I get that this can be frustrating! 
  * Troubleshooting codespaces isn't how I want you to be spending your time
  * I have some suggestions of things to try if you run into problems
  
  
## Problems with `git push`

Most of the problems I've seen with `git push` might look something like this:

```
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/UWT-TME-310/...
```

The most likely cause is that your codespace is "behind" your repo (aka `origin`).

```
Before attempted push:
    A---B---C  (origin/main)
         \
          D---E  (codespace/main)

```


1. Try merging changes
2. Ask Copilot
3. Save locally and restart

## Try merging changes

Use these commands:

```
git config pull.rebase false
git pull
```

You'll be prompted for a commit message

## What's going on?
```
Before attempted push:
    A---B---C  (origin/main)
         \
          D---E  (codespace/main)

After git config pull.rebase false AND git pull:
    A---B-------C  (origin/main)
         \       \
          D---E---F (codespace/main)
```

Now you can `git push`

```
After git push:
    A---B-------C   F (origin/main)
         \       \ /
          D---E---F (codespace/main)
```


## Ask Copilot

Even if you don't try the previous method, you can ask Copilot to help you.

* Turn "Agent" mode on
* Ask: "help me with git push"
* Allow copilot to run terminal commands
  * ![](allow_copilot_commands.png){width=30%}
* After several commands and checks, it will almost always get to a successful push

## Save locally and restart

If you're really tangled in a knot, make a copy of what you want to keep locally and start a new codespace from your repo.

* Your notebook and everything else in your file explorer can be downloaded.
* Or you can just copy and paste the contents if that's easier for you.
* After you've saved everything you want to keep, delete the problematic codespace and start a new one.

## Problems with the codespace itself

You might also have problems with the codespace itself...

* `codespace running in recovery mode`...
* `There is no Pip installer`...
* If you're seeing this kind of issue, follow the "Save locally and restart" steps.
