## Introduction
### About the course 
Read the syllabus! 

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
But here are some quick highlights.
The course focuses on:
::: 

::: incremental
* Understanding the "modeling framework"
* Using coding (implemented in Python) to perform engineering analysis
* Evaluating computer output
  * Are the AI tools helping write the Python code you want?
  * Is the Python code doing what you want?
:::

## Introduction
### About me
::: incremental
* 7 years of professional engineering experience
  * Geotechnical engineering (mechanics of earth materials and their interactions with built infrastructure). 
* I chose to major in civil engineering <br>to avoid coding 
* Then I went to graduate school <br>and spent 4 years coding ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

* Eventually, I enjoyed coding!

## Introduction
### About you
::: incremental
* What's your
  * Name
  * Major
  * Future hobby

## Modern Coding
::: {.fragment .fade-up}
Using AI tools to help you generate code is encouraged.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
As a modeler and engineer, you are responsible for the content you submit.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
You will have to understand Python code to be successful in this course. 
But you don't need to start with a blank slate!
:::

## Coding Platform
The course will use GitHub for assignments (links through Canvas).
A coding environment with Copilot is provided through GitHub Codespaces.

::: incremental
Git
: software for tracking and controlling your files

Repository (or "repo")
: a collection of files and folders

GitHub
: an online service for managing your repos with Git
:::

## Brace yourself

::: incremental
These tools serve the learning goals of the class.

And they're good things to know.

But they can be painful at first.

## Modeling Framework {.smaller}

The modeling framework we'll use in this course consists of four **elements** and four **activities**.

## Today's Plan

We're going to try to work on **Homework 1**.
Homework 1 is primarily about making sure you can access and use the tools you'll need to complete course assignments.

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Let's head to Canvas and step through the GitHub Classroom assignment process.

## GitHub Classroom

If you haven't done so already, head to Canvas and click the link under **Homework 1** that will take you to GitHub Classroom.
