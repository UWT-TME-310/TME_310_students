# Course Project


## Project groups

Project groups will be assigned randomly by the instructor. 
Each group will have 3 to 4 students.

## Topic

The project topic is modeling the installation of driven piles with open-ended diesel hammers (the topic of Homework 3, Problem 1).

Each team will build a jupyter notebook interactive app to predict the capacity of a driven pile based on data collected during installation.

There will be a baseline app to be delivered in Part 2 and then the groups will choose additional features to include to enhance their app for Part 3.

## Deliverables

The project will have three deliverables:

1.  [Group coordination](project_01.qmd) (due week 5)
2.  [Basic pile-driving app](project_02.qmd) (due week 7)
3.  Enhanced pile-driving app (due finals week)
