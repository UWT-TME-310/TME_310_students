# Course Project

It's a group project.

Groups will be assigned randomly. Groups will be 3 or 4 students.

## Topic

The project topic is modeling the installation of driven piles with open-ended diesel hammers.

Each team will build a jupyter notebook interactive app to predict the capacity of a driven pile based on data collected during installation.

There will be a baseline app to be delivered in Part 2 and then the groups will choose additional features to include to enhance their app for Part 3.

## Deliverables

The project will have three deliverables:

1.  Group coordination (due week 3)
2.  Basic pile-driving app (due week 6)
3.  Enhanced pile-driving app (due finals week)
