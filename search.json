Before I started teaching, I worked as a geotechnical engineer for many years, designing foundations for buildings, bridges, and ports. I’m looking forward to getting to know you all this term.\n\n\n\nI am here to guide you as you learn and practice new skills. We will spend a lot of time writing code together and learning from one another. I hope you will all be generous in helping one another during this class. Engineering is very collaborative, so that is an extra skill to practice.\nOnline Availability: I’m online between 8 AM and 5 PM most days, and I’ll try to keep Canvas and GitHub open when I’m not otherwise engaged. From time to time, I will check in after 5 PM, but family obligations will make evening responses from me hit or miss. You can expect to get responses to questions from me in less than one day. Graded quizzes and projects will be typically be returned in less than one week.\nIf you’re looking for help outside of the course’s normal office hours, you can book a meeting with me using my booking link.\nFeedback: I care a lot about improving my teaching. Teaching is not a formula to learn, so I am still working on my own methods in the classroom. I would love to hear from you frequently about how things are going so I can improve over time. Send me a note, a chat, or catch me after class if you have ideas for improvements.\nUnderstanding and flexibility: Every quarter, some students will encounter unavoidable problems that prevent them from completing course assignments on time. The course grading is structured to be fairly flexible. For example, we will drop your lowest in-person quiz score. Let me know if something comes up, and do the best you can to stay on track.",

The concepts are practiced through examples involving differential equations and programming with computational linear algebra.\n\n\n\nThis course is designed to enable students to meet the following learning objectives:\n\nCreate models of different kinds of systems (e.g., populations, thermal systems, mechanical systems) using multiple kinds of appropriate abstractions (e.g., free-body diagrams, differential equations), validate the predictions of models using different approaches (e.g., estimation, physical laws, analytical solutions), and use models to accomplish useful tasks (e.g., make predictions, explain behavior, evaluate design decisions).\nBe a critical consumer of models (e.g., by assessing a model you encounter and evaluating whether it is appropriate and useful for a given purpose).\nUse code-cased numerical tools to implement models, run simulations, work with data, and generate visualizations.\nCommunicate technical and quantitative information effectively using written and graphical media.\nWork effectively in teams to produce technical deliverables.\n\n\n\n\nUsing AI tools (which I’ll generically use to mean LLMs, generative models, coding agents, etc.) to help you generate code for homework assignments, in-class exercises, and projects is encouraged in this course. As a modeler and an engineer, you are responsible for all the work you submit. Which means that: - You should be able to explain each line of code you submit, whether you used AI on the submission or not. - If you cannot understand the code you submit, you are doing yourself a major disservice.\nIf used properly, AI tools can enhance your learning by allowing you to dig deeper into the physical significance of the models discussed in this course. If used without critically thinking about each line of code generated, AI tools can inhibit your learning by allowing you to complete assignments without understanding what it represents.\nUsing AI tools (or any internet resource, for that matter) is not allowed during in-class quizzes! This makes it all the more important to understand course concepts and not use AI to short-circuit your learning.\nIn short, AI is a tool. Use your tools wisely!\n\n\n\nThis course will have pre-recorded lectures and in-person instruction and exercises. Class sessions will involve a brief lecture recap followed by in-class exercises (ICEs) designed to help you with the weekly homework and/or project.\nI encourage you to work together with your classmates on the ICEs. We will have a quiz every two weeks in class on Thursday.\nOffice hours will be held immediately after class in the same room. I will stick around for an hour after the scheduled class time to help answer questions and work with you on assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will receive a homework assignment roughly every week. You should begin working on your assignment the day it is assigned. The description of the assignment will be posted on Canvas. Homework grades will be based on completeness and answers to reflection questions, rather than the correctness of your Python scripts. Homework should be your own work, but you may consult with classmates and use online resources to help. It is very important that you understand every line of code you submit.\n\n\n\nBiweekly on Thursday, we will have a quiz based on the most recently covered homework. Quiz dates are shown on the course schedule below. The lowest quiz score will be dropped at the end of the term.\nQuizzes are closed-book, closed-notes, individual activities. Consulting any external sources (internet, friend, etc.) is an academic integrity violation. Posting quiz materials or information to a website or sharing it with others is also a violation of academic integrity.\n\n\n\nThe course will culminate with a group project focused on implementing the numerical methods learned.\nEach team will submit a written report and include the source code for the project.\n\n\n\nPre-recorded lecture videos will be posted to Canvas as assignments. Additionally, occasional small assignments (e.g., surveys, low-stakes problems) may be assigned throughout the quarter.\n\n\n\n\nThe schedule below is preliminary and subject to change without notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nTuesday\nThursday\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n1\n–\nIntroductions, Engineering modeling concept (Ch. 1)\n\n\n\n2\nModeling framework\nProblem-solving\n\n\n\n3\nApproximation and error\nRoot finding Quiz 1\nProject Part 1 due\n\n\n4\nRoot finding\nRoot finding\n\n\n\n5\nMatrices\nMatrices Quiz 2\n\n\n\n6\nMatrices\nMatrices\nProject Part 2 due\n\n\n7\nSystems of equations\nSystems of equations Quiz 3\n\n\n\n8\nNo class (Veterans Day)\nNumerical differentiation\n\n\n\n9\nNumerical differentiation\nNumerical differentiation Quiz 4\n\n\n\n10\nNumerical integration\nNo class (Thanskgiving)\n\n\n\n11\nNumerical integration\n\n\n\n\nFinals week\nQuiz 5\n\nProject Part 3 due\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSO 1: an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics\nSO 6: an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions\n\n\n\nFor information on other campus and student resources, including Policies and Expectations (including religious accommodation), Academic Support, and Self & Family Resources, visit The e-Syllabus: Campus Information, Resources, Policies and Expectations page.",

    "text": "The course is designed to be run through GitHub Codespaces, which provides a web-based coding environment with everything you need pre-installed. For every assignment, when you accept the assignment in GitHub Classroom, a new GitHub repo will be created for you automatically. You can start a codespace for the assignment by clicking on the “Code” dropdown and selecting “Create codespace on main.” You should only need to do this once for each assignment.\nThis will launch a new codespace with the assignment files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt takes a few minutes for the codespace to get started and install all the requirements for the first time! Be patient - it’s essentially starting up a brand new computer from scratch. It will go faster the next time you open the codespace.\n\n\n\n\nAn un-graded “sandbox” assignment has been created so you can work on code independently of homework assignments if you’d like.\n\n\n\nThe codespaces run VS Code in a web browser. There are a few main areas you’ll want to navigate to use VS Code:\n\n\n\n\nPrimary sidebar: This area is set up to show the file explorer by default.\nActivity bar: The activity bar touches the primary sidebar and lets you select different content to show in the primary sidebar.\nSecondary sidebar: This area is set up to show the GitHub Copilot Chat. You can use this area to ask Copilot questions about your code.\nEditor: This is where your notebooks and scripts will open.\nPanel: This area sits beneath your editor and between the sidebars. This is where your Terminal and Jupyter Variables containers will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe positions of all the interface areas can be adjusted. Feel free to adjust them if you have a layout preference, but it can be a bit frustrating if you misplace something, so I recommend against it unless you’re familiar with VS Code and have a specific layout you prefer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way you submit your assignments with GitHub Classroom is by committing and pushing your changes. There are multiple ways to accomplish this, but I recommend using a few git commands in the terminal. The three commands are all you should need:\n\ngit add . This adds all the changes you’ve made to what will be committed.\ngit commit -m \"your message here\" This commits the changes in your codespaace and attaches a message to them. Of course, you can replace the text in the example with whatever message you want to include. In general, commit messages are supposed to be a brief description of the changes you made since the last commit.\ngit push This pushes your committed changes back to the repo.\n\nYou can create and push as many commits as you want. When grading, I’ll use whichever version existed at the time of the deadline unless you arrange something else with me. I recommend pushing your changes any time you’re planning to pause your work and close your codespace. The codespace should automatically save your changes and keep them, but it is possible to permanently lose changes if you delete the codespace (which is different than just closing the browser/tab) if they weren’t pushed to the repo.\n\n\n\nYour codespace includes the GitHub Copilot extension, which provides you with a powerful AI coding assistant. I encourage you to interact with Copilot and ask it questions about your code. It can write code for you based on instructions you provide and it can read your files to get additional context. In addition to experimenting with Copilot on your own, I encourage you to watch the Copilot videos listed on the Resources Page.\nRegardless of how you use copilot, you are responsible for all the code and text you submit.\n\n\nThere are some things Copilot can do that I’ve turned off on your codespaces. The features aren’t truly removed, just suppressed. They aren’t turned off to prevent you from using them, it’s more that I think they’re more likely to cause problems than be helpful.\nI’ve specifically configured Copilot to provide coding help based on where we’re at in the course. This is intended to prevent it from using Python language features we don’t cover in this class and may be difficult for you to interpret. If there are more advanced uses of Python you want to try, Copilot will help you with them if you ask it to “please override” the course’s coding assistance guidelines.\n\n\n\n\nThe codespace settings are all contained in the GitHub repos and you will have the ability to view, modify, and delete them. By default, I’ve set the codespace to hide these configuration files, but you’ll be able to see them in the repo. I’ve “hidden” them so that it’s difficult for you to accidentally break something about the codespace, not because I don’t want you to see them. If you have experience with the kinds of configuration files in the repo and you want to modify them, you may. But be warned: I can’t guarantee that I’ll be able to fix something if you break it and you’ll still be responsible for completing your assignments.",

Today, we’ll cover some of the most commonly-used ones:\n\nint (numeric integers)\nfloat (numeric real numbers)\nbool (true or false)\nstring (text)\nlist (collection of other objects)\n\n\nint\nAn int is an integer value (e.g., 1 or -395). In Python, we can check the type of an object with the built-in type() function.\n\n# An integer\ntype(1)\n\nint\n\n\n\n# Another integer\ntype(-395)\n\nint\n\n\n\n\nfloat\nA float is another numeric data type in Python. Unlike an int, a float is a real number that can have several decimal places. For example:\n\n# A floating point number\ntype(9.81)\n\nfloat\n\n\nNote that any number with a decimal place will be interpreted as a float by Python, even if there’s nothing after the decimal place:\n\n# This is also a floating point number\ntype(1.)\n\nfloat\n\n\n\n\nbool\nA bool (boolean) represents True or False values. These are useful for yes/no questions.\n\n# In Python True and False are capitalized\ntype(True)\n\nbool\n\n\n\ntype(False)\n\nbool\n\n\n\n\nstr\nA string (or str) represents text. Strings are surrounded by quotes. Either single or double quotes can be used to surround strings:\n\n# A double-quoted string\ntype(\"hello\")\n\nstr\n\n\n\n# A single-quoted string\ntype('world')\n\nstr\n\n\nIt’s considered best practice to use double quotes for strings even though single quotes are accepted by Python. More importantly, whichever kind of quote starts the string has to be used to close it, or you’ll get a syntax error!\n\n# This will cause an error!\ntype('mismatch\")\n\n\n  Cell In[9], line 2\n    type('mismatch\")\n         ^\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlist\nA list is a collection of other objects. Lists are surrounded by square brackets [] with their elements separated by commas.\n\n# A list of integers\ntype([1, 2, 3])\n\nlist\n\n\nThe elements of a list don’t need to be the same type.\n\n# A list of mixed types\ntype([1, \"two\", 3.0, True])\n\nlist\n\n\n\n# Even another list:\ntype([1, 2, [\"I'm\", \"a\", \"list\"], 4])\n\nlist"

Python will always interpret variables based on their values at the time of execution, which may not reflect the expected values based on a linear reading of the notebook.\n\n\nDivision in Python will often look how you’d expect, but there are some details worth examining. The basic division operator is /, which works on int and float data types, but always returns a float. This is because it converts anything it’s operating on into a float before performing division. So, even if it’s used between two integers and the result could be represented as an integer, the resulting data type will be float.\n\n# Division\nz = 15 / 3\nprint(z) # z is a float even though 15 can be divided by 3 evenly\n\n5.0\n\n\nTo perform integer division in Python, use the // operator. This performs division and returns the result rounded down to the next smallest whole number.\n\n# Returns an integer result (no rounding needed)\n15 // 3\n\n5\n\n\n\n# This result gets rounded to the next smallest whole number\n13 // 3\n\n4\n\n\nWhen you first learned to divide, you probably used “remainders” when numbers didn’t divide evenly. So the answer to 13 divided by 3 would have been 4 remainder 1. The integer division operator in Python ignores the remainder, but another useful operator provides it - the modulo operator: %.\n\n# The remainder after integer division\n13 % 3\n\n1\n\n\nThe ** operator means “to the power of”. So 2 ** 3 means 2 to the power of 3.\n\n2 ** 3\n\n8"

    "section": "Strings",
    "text": "Strings\nAlthough strings are text, not numbers, some of the operators discussed above can be used with strings. But, of course, they have different meanings when text is involved.\nFor example, “adding” two strings sticks the two pieces of text together:\n\n\"hello\" + \" world\"\n\n'hello world'\n\n\nMultiplying a string creates multiple copies of the original text and sticks them all together:\n\n\" alright \" * 3\n\n' alright  alright  alright '\n\n\nOther operators (like - or /) don’t have unique meaning with strings, so they aren’t allowed. Trying to use them will result in an error:\n\n\"hello\" - \" world\"  # This will cause an error\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[28], line 1\n----&gt; 1 \"hello\" - \" world\"  # This will cause an error\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'\n\n\n\nThe len() function returns the number of characters in a string:\n\nlen(\"This is a string. It's not super long, but it's long enough that I don't want to count the characters myself.\")\n\n109\n\n\nOne of the most useful features Python has for strings is the “F-string”. With F-strings, you can put variables inside your strings (inside curly braces {}) and get the variable value inserted into your string.\n\ncourse = \"TME 310A\"\nstudents = 25\nmax_grade = 4.0\n\nprint(f\"There are {students} students registered for {course}. The highest grade you can get is {max_grade}\")\n\nThere are 25 students registered for TME 310A. The highest grade you can get is 4.0\n\n\nStrings are indexed, which means that each character in the string has a numbered position (called an index). You can access the \\(n\\)th character in a string putting the index you want in square brackets after the string:\n\nmy_string = \"abstraction\"\nmy_string[2]\n\n's'\n\n\nDepending on what languages you’ve programmed in before, you may have expected my_string[2] to return b since that’s the 2nd character in the string. But Python is a “zero-indexed” language, so counting always starts at zero. To get the first character in the string, we need to put 0 in square brackets:\n\nmy_string[0]\n\n'a'\n\n\nTrying to access an index past the end of the string will cause an error:\n\ntoo_far = len(my_string)\nmy_string[too_far] # This will cause an error\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[33], line 2\n      1 too_far = len(my_string)\n----&gt; 2 my_string[too_far] # This will cause an error\n\nIndexError: string index out of range\n\n\n\nNotice that the trying to access and index equal to the length of the string causes IndexError: string index out of range because the indexing starts at 0! That means that the last entry in the string will have the value len(my_string) - 1.\nIn fact, Python supports negative indexing without needing to find the length of the string. The last entry in the string has index -1; and the second to last entry has index -2, and so on.\n\nmy_string[-1] # This will give the last character of the string\n\n'n'\n\n\n\nmy_string[-2] # This will give the second to last character of the string\n\n'o'"

    "title": "Python Basics for Computational Physical Modeling",
    "section": "Lists",
    "text": "Lists\nWe’ve already seen that lists are containers that hold objects. Now we’ll discuss how to interact with these containers.\nLike strings, lists are indexed data types, so we can use the indexing syntax to access specific values in a list:\n\ncolors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]\n\n# Print the first item in the list:\nprint(colors[0])\n\nred\n\n\nOne of the key differences between lists and strings is that lists are mutable, while strings are immutable. This means that you can change the value of an entry in a list, but you can’t with a string:\n\n# Change the second color from \"green\" to \"yellow\":\ncolors[1] = \"yellow\"\nprint(colors)\n\n['red', 'yellow', 'blue']\n\n\n\n# Trying to change one of the characters in a string will cause an error:\nmy_string[0] = \"A\" # This will cause an error\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[38], line 2\n      1 # Trying to change one of the characters in a string will cause an error:\n----&gt; 2 my_string[0] = \"A\" # This will cause an error\n\nTypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n\n\n\nCopying A major implication of whether an object is mutable or not is how Python handles copies of the object. We saw previously that when we made a copy of an integer variable, changing the original variable did not change the copy. This kind of copying is called deep copying. It’s the default behavior for immutable objects in Python so the same applies to strings:\n\n# Make a string and copy it\noriginal_string = \"TME 310A\"\ncopied_string = original_string\nprint(original_string)\nprint(copied_string)\n\nTME 310A\nTME 310A\n\n\n\n# Change the original string\noriginal_string = \"TME 310B\"\n\n# The copy is unchanged\nprint(original_string)\nprint(copied_string)\n\nTME 310B\nTME 310A\n\n\nBut since lists are mutable, when they’re copied, Python makes what’s called a shallow copy. A shallow copy points to the original rather than reproducing it. This means that a change to the original will immediately cause a change in the “copy”. And, strangely enough, a change in the copy will immediately change the original!\n\n# Make a list and copy it\noriginal_list = [ 1, 2, 3 ]\ncopied_list = original_list\nprint(original_list)\nprint(copied_list)\n\n[1, 2, 3]\n[1, 2, 3]\n\n\n\n# Change the original list\noriginal_list[0] = 99\n\n# Both the original and the \"copy\" are changed!\nprint(original_list)\nprint(copied_list)\n\n[99, 2, 3]\n[99, 2, 3]\n\n\n\n# Change the copy\ncopied_list[-1] = -5\n\n# The original gets changed too!\nprint(original_list)\nprint(copied_list)\n\n[99, 2, -5]\n[99, 2, -5]"

Conditional statements (like the if statement) have three parts: 1. The keyword 2. The test condition followed by a colon : 3. An indented codeblock that is executed if the test condition is True\nFor example:\n\ntemperature = 65                # a variable representing the temperature\n\nif temperature &gt; 70:            # The \"if\" keyword, the test condition, and a colon\n    print(\"It's warm outside\")  # An indented codeblock that runs if the test condition is True\n\nThe other conditional statements, else and elif (short for “else if”) use the same syntax as the if statement, but the must come after an if or elif statement. They can be used to execute different indented codeblocks under different circumstances.\nFor example:\n\ntemperature = 65  \n\nif temperature &gt; 70: \n    print(\"It's warm outside\")\nelif temperature &lt; 50:\n    print(\"It's cold outside\")\nelse:\n    print(\"It's a nice day\")\n\nIt's a nice day"

The for loop goes through each item in an iterable object, like a list:\n\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"]\n\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n\napple\nbanana\norange\n\n\nThe range() function creates an iterable sequence of numbers that can be used to control a for loop:\n\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nThe while loop repeats as long as a condition is True.\n\ncount = 0\n\nwhile count &lt; 3:\n    print(f\"Count is {count}\")\n    count = count + 1\n\nCount is 0\nCount is 1\nCount is 2\n\n\nThe example above is not a great use of a while loop because the same thing can be accomplished with a for loop and while loops have the potential to run forever (or until you manually force the computer to stop). That’s called an “infinite loop” and can be a pain if triggered accidentally in your code. In the code above, if you left out the list line in the loop, for example, the value of count would never increase and the conditional test (count &lt; 3) would always be True and the loop would run forever.\nIt’s best to reserve while loops for situations where you’re uncertain how many iterations are needed."
