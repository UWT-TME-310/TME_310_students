I also include a factor of \\(2 \\pi\\) radians so that one second corresponds to one full sine period.\n\ntime = np.linspace(0, 3, 500)\namplitude = np.sin(2 * np.pi * time)\n\nUse plt.subplots() to create a figure and axes to plot on. Add the plot to the axes with the plot(x, y) method, providing time as the x variable and amplitude as the y variable.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(time, amplitude)\nax.set(xlabel='Time (s)', ylabel='Amplitude', title='Sine Wave')\nax.grid()\nplt.show()"

    "text": "Computational methods for analyzing mathematical representations of physical systems. The concepts are practiced through examples involving differential equations and programming with computational linear algebra.\n\n\n\nThis course is designed to enable students to meet the following learning objectives:\n\nCreate models of different kinds of systems (e.g., populations, thermal systems, mechanical systems) using multiple kinds of appropriate abstractions (e.g., free-body diagrams, differential equations), validate the predictions of models using different approaches (e.g., estimation, physical laws, analytical solutions), and use models to accomplish useful tasks (e.g., make predictions, explain behavior, evaluate design decisions).\nBe a critical consumer of models (e.g., by assessing a model you encounter and evaluating whether it is appropriate and useful for a given purpose).\nUse code-cased numerical tools to implement models, run simulations, work with data, and generate visualizations.\nCommunicate technical and quantitative information effectively using written and graphical media.\nWork effectively in teams to produce technical deliverables.\n\n\n\n\nUsing AI tools (which I’ll generically use to mean LLMs, generative models, coding agents, etc.) to help you generate code for homework assignments, in-class exercises, and projects is encouraged in this course. As a modeler and an engineer, you are responsible for all the work you submit. Which means that: - You should be able to explain each line of code you submit, whether you used AI on the submission or not. - If you cannot understand the code you submit, you are doing yourself a major disservice.\nIf used properly, AI tools can enhance your learning by allowing you to dig deeper into the physical significance of the models discussed in this course. If used without critically thinking about each line of code generated, AI tools can inhibit your learning by allowing you to complete assignments without understanding what it represents.\nUsing AI tools (or any internet resource, for that matter) is not allowed during in-class quizzes! This makes it all the more important to understand course concepts and not use AI to short-circuit your learning.\nIn short, AI is a tool. Use your tools wisely!\n\n\n\nThis course will have pre-recorded lectures and in-person instruction and exercises. Class sessions will involve a brief lecture recap followed by in-class exercises (ICEs) designed to help you with the weekly homework and/or project.\nI encourage you to work together with your classmates on the ICEs. We will have a quiz every two weeks in class on Thursday.\nOffice hours will be held immediately after class in the same room. I will stick around for an hour after the scheduled class time to help answer questions and work with you on assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost days during class, an exercise problem will be assigned. Students are encouraged to work together to solve the problem and be willing to discuss their results in class. These exercises will help you prepare for homework. In-Class exercises (ICEs) should be your own work, but you may consult classmates and use online resources to help.\n\n\n\nYou will receive a homework assignment every week. You should begin working on your assignment the day it is assigned. The description of the assignment will be posted on Canvas. Homework grades will be based on completeness and answers to reflection questions, rather than the correctness of your Python scripts. However, knowing how to create useful Python scripts is important in the course, so you’re encouraged to review homework solutions when they’re posted and compare the solutions with your own work. Homework should be your own work, but you may consult with classmates and use online resources to help. It is very important that you understand every line of code you submit.\n\n\n\nBiweekly on Thursday, we will have a quiz based on the most recently covered homework. Quiz dates are shown on the course schedule below. The lowest quiz score will be dropped at the end of the term.\nQuizzes are closed-book, closed-notes, individual activities. Consulting any external sources (internet, friend, etc.) is an academic integrity violation. Posting quiz materials or information to a website or sharing it with others is also a violation of academic integrity.\n\n\n\nThe course will culminate with a group project focused on implementing the numerical methods learned.\nEach team will submit a written report and include the source code for the project.\n\n\n\n\nThe schedule below is preliminary and subject to change without notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nTuesday\nThursday\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n1\n–\nIntroductions, Engineering modeling concept (Ch. 1)\n\n\n\n2\nProgram flow (notes)\nApproximation and error (Ch. 3.2) Quiz 1\nProject groups formed\n\n\n3\nApproximation and error (Ch. 3)\nRoot finding (Ch. 3)\n\n\n\n4\nRoot finding (Ch. 3)\nRoot finding (Ch. 3) Quiz 2\n\n\n\n5\nMatrices (Ch. 2, 4)\nMatrices (Ch. 2, 4)\n\n\n\n6\nMatrices (Ch. 2, 4)\nMatrices (Ch. 2, 4) Quiz 3\n\n\n\n7\nSystems of equations (Ch. 2, 4)\nSystems of equations (Ch. 2, 4)\nProject Part 1 due\n\n\n8\nNumerical differentiation\nNumerical differentiation Quiz 4\n\n\n\n9\nNumerical differentiation (Ch. 8)\nNumerical differentiation (Ch. 8)\n\n\n\n10\nNumerical integration (Ch. 9)\nNumerical integration (Ch. 9) Quiz 5\n\n\n\n11\nNumerical integration (Ch. 9)\n\n\n\n\nFinals week\nQuiz 6\n\nProject Part 2 due\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSO 1: an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics\nSO 6: an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions\n\n\n\nFor information on other campus and student resources, including Policies and Expectations (including religious accommodation), Academic Support, and Self & Family Resources, visit The e-Syllabus: Campus Information, Resources, Policies and Expectations page.",

    "text": "My name is Lorne Arnold. I like to sail, listen to music, and take naps. Before I started teaching, I worked as a geotechnical engineer for many years, designing foundations for buildings, bridges, and ports. I’m looking forward to getting to know you all this term.\n\n\n\nI am here to guide you as you learn and practice new skills. We will spend a lot of time writing code together and learning from one another. I hope you will all be generous in helping one another during this class. Engineering is very collaborative, so that is an extra skill to practice.\nOnline Availability: I’m online between 8 AM and 5 PM most days, and I’ll try to keep Canvas and GitHub open when I’m not otherwise engaged. From time to time, I will check in after 5 PM, but family obligations will make evening responses from me hit or miss. You can expect to get responses to questions from me in less than one day. Graded quizzes and projects will be typically be returned in less than one week.\nIf you’re looking for help outside of the course’s normal office hours, you can book a meeting with me using my booking link.\nFeedback: I care a lot about improving my teaching. Teaching is not a formula to learn, so I am still working on my own methods in the classroom. I would love to hear from you frequently about how things are going so I can improve over time. Send me a note, a chat, or catch me after class if you have ideas for improvements.\nUnderstanding and flexibility: Every quarter, some students will encounter unavoidable problems that prevent them from completing course assignments on time. The course grading is structured to be fairly flexible. For example, we will drop your lowest in-person quiz score. Let me know if something comes up, and do the best you can to stay on track.",
