Today, we’ll cover some of the most commonly-used ones:\n\nint (numeric integers)\nfloat (numeric real numbers)\nbool (true or false)\nstring (text)\nlist (collection of other objects)\n\n\nint\nAn int is an integer value (e.g., 1 or -395). In Python, we can check the type of an object with the built-in type() function.\n\n# An integer\ntype(1)\n\nint\n\n\n\n# Another integer\ntype(-395)\n\nint\n\n\n\n\nfloat\nA float is another numeric data type in Python. Unlike an int, a float is a real number that can have several decimal places. For example:\n\n# A floating point number\ntype(9.81)\n\nfloat\n\n\nNote that any number with a decimal place will be interpreted as a float by Python, even if there’s nothing after the decimal place:\n\n# This is also a floating point number\ntype(1.)\n\nfloat\n\n\n\n\nbool\nA bool (boolean) represents True or False values. These are useful for yes/no questions.\n\n# In Python True and False are capitalized\ntype(True)\n\nbool\n\n\n\ntype(False)\n\nbool\n\n\n\n\nstr\nA string (or str) represents text. Strings are surrounded by quotes. Either single or double quotes can be used to surround strings:\n\n# A double-quoted string\ntype(\"hello\")\n\nstr\n\n\n\n# A single-quoted string\ntype('world')\n\nstr\n\n\nIt’s considered best practice to use double quotes for strings even though single quotes are accepted by Python. More importantly, whichever kind of quote starts the string has to be used to close it, or you’ll get a syntax error!\n\n# This will cause an error!\ntype('mismatch\")\n\n\n  Cell In[9], line 2\n    type('mismatch\")\n         ^\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlist\nA list is a collection of other objects. Lists are surrounded by square brackets [] with their elements separated by commas.\n\n# A list of integers\ntype([1, 2, 3])\n\nlist\n\n\nThe elements of a list don’t need to be the same type.\n\n# A list of mixed types\ntype([1, \"two\", 3.0, True])\n\nlist\n\n\n\n# Even another list:\ntype([1, 2, [\"I'm\", \"a\", \"list\"], 4])\n\nlist"

    "text": "Numbers and Math\nMost arithmetic operations in Python act like you’d expect. For example:\n\n# Addition\nw = 20 + 34\nprint(w)\n\n54\n\n\n\n# Subtraction\nx = 10 - 4\nprint(x)\n\n6\n\n\n\n# Multiplication\ny = 3 * 7\nprint(y)\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThis is a good place to note one of the potential sources of error in Jupyter notebooks.\nNow that we’ve just overwritten the variable y with a new value, go back to the Variables section and run the cell that contains print(y). Python will always interpret variables based on their values at the time of execution, which may not reflect the expected values based on a linear reading of the notebook.\n\n\nDivision in Python will often look how you’d expect, but there are some details worth examining. The basic division operator is /, which works on int and float data types, but always returns a float. This is because it converts anything it’s operating on into a float before performing division. So, even if it’s used between two integers and the result could be represented as an integer, the resulting data type will be float.\n\n# Division\nz = 15 / 3\nprint(z) # z is a float even though 15 can be divided by 3 evenly\n\n5.0\n\n\nTo perform integer division in Python, use the // operator. This performs division and returns the result rounded down to the next smallest whole number.\n\n# Returns an integer result (no rounding needed)\n15 // 3\n\n5\n\n\n\n# This result gets rounded to the next smallest whole number\n13 // 3\n\n4\n\n\nWhen you first learned to divide, you probably used “remainders” when numbers didn’t divide evenly. So the answer to 13 divided by 3 would have been 4 remainder 1. The integer division operator in Python ignores the remainder, but another useful operator provides it - the modulo operator: %.\n\n# The remainder after integer division\n13 % 3\n\n1\n\n\nThe ** operator means “to the power of”. So 2 ** 3 means 2 to the power of 3.\n\n2 ** 3\n\n8"

    "section": "Strings",
    "text": "Strings\nAlthough strings are text, not numbers, some of the operators discussed above can be used with strings. But, of course, they have different meanings when text is involved.\nFor example, “adding” two strings sticks the two pieces of text together:\n\n\"hello\" + \" world\"\n\n'hello world'\n\n\nMultiplying a string creates multiple copies of the original text and sticks them all together:\n\n\" alright \" * 3\n\n' alright  alright  alright '\n\n\nOther operators (like - or /) don’t have unique meaning with strings, so they aren’t allowed. Trying to use them will result in an error:\n\n\"hello\" - \" world\"  # This will cause an error\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[28], line 1\n----&gt; 1 \"hello\" - \" world\"  # This will cause an error\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'\n\n\n\nThe len() function returns the number of characters in a string:\n\nlen(\"This is a string. It's not super long, but it's long enough that I don't want to count the characters myself.\")\n\n109\n\n\nOne of the most useful features Python has for strings is the “F-string”. With F-strings, you can put variables inside your strings (inside curly braces {}) and get the variable value inserted into your string.\n\ncourse = \"TME 310A\"\nstudents = 25\nmax_grade = 4.0\n\nprint(f\"There are {students} students registered for {course}. The highest grade you can get is {max_grade}\")\n\nThere are 25 students registered for TME 310A. The highest grade you can get is 4.0\n\n\nStrings are indexed, which means that each character in the string has a numbered position (called an index). You can access the \\(n\\)th character in a string putting the index you want in square brackets after the string:\n\nmy_string = \"abstraction\"\nmy_string[2]\n\n's'\n\n\nDepending on what languages you’ve programmed in before, you may have expected my_string[2] to return b since that’s the 2nd character in the string. But Python is a “zero-indexed” language, so counting always starts at zero. To get the first character in the string, we need to put 0 in square brackets:\n\nmy_string[0]\n\n'a'\n\n\nTrying to access an index past the end of the string will cause an error:\n\ntoo_far = len(my_string)\nmy_string[too_far] # This will cause an error\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[33], line 2\n      1 too_far = len(my_string)\n----&gt; 2 my_string[too_far] # This will cause an error\n\nIndexError: string index out of range\n\n\n\nNotice that the trying to access and index equal to the length of the string causes IndexError: string index out of range because the indexing starts at 0! That means that the last entry in the string will have the value len(my_string) - 1.\nIn fact, Python supports negative indexing without needing to find the length of the string. The last entry in the string has index -1; and the second to last entry has index -2, and so on.\n\nmy_string[-1] # This will give the last character of the string\n\n'n'\n\n\n\nmy_string[-2] # This will give the second to last character of the string\n\n'o'"

    "title": "Python Basics for Computational Physical Modeling",
    "section": "Lists",
    "text": "Lists\nWe’ve already seen that lists are containers that hold objects. Now we’ll discuss how to interact with these containers.\nLike strings, lists are indexed data types, so we can use the indexing syntax to access specific values in a list:\n\ncolors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]\n\n# Print the first item in the list:\nprint(colors[0])\n\nred\n\n\nOne of the key differences between lists and strings is that lists are mutable, while strings are immutable. This means that you can change the value of an entry in a list, but you can’t with a string:\n\n# Change the second color from \"green\" to \"yellow\":\ncolors[1] = \"yellow\"\nprint(colors)\n\n['red', 'yellow', 'blue']\n\n\n\n# Trying to change one of the characters in a string will cause an error:\nmy_string[0] = \"A\" # This will cause an error\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[38], line 2\n      1 # Trying to change one of the characters in a string will cause an error:\n----&gt; 2 my_string[0] = \"A\" # This will cause an error\n\nTypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n\n\n\nCopying A major implication of whether an object is mutable or not is how Python handles copies of the object. We saw previously that when we made a copy of an integer variable, changing the original variable did not change the copy. This kind of copying is called deep copying. It’s the default behavior for immutable objects in Python so the same applies to strings:\n\n# Make a string and copy it\noriginal_string = \"TME 310A\"\ncopied_string = original_string\nprint(original_string)\nprint(copied_string)\n\nTME 310A\nTME 310A\n\n\n\n# Change the original string\noriginal_string = \"TME 310B\"\n\n# The copy is unchanged\nprint(original_string)\nprint(copied_string)\n\nTME 310B\nTME 310A\n\n\nBut since lists are mutable, when they’re copied, Python makes what’s called a shallow copy. A shallow copy points to the original rather than reproducing it. This means that a change to the original will immediately cause a change in the “copy”. And, strangely enough, a change in the copy will immediately change the original!\n\n# Make a list and copy it\noriginal_list = [ 1, 2, 3 ]\ncopied_list = original_list\nprint(original_list)\nprint(copied_list)\n\n[1, 2, 3]\n[1, 2, 3]\n\n\n\n# Change the original list\noriginal_list[0] = 99\n\n# Both the original and the \"copy\" are changed!\nprint(original_list)\nprint(copied_list)\n\n[99, 2, 3]\n[99, 2, 3]\n\n\n\n# Change the copy\ncopied_list[-1] = -5\n\n# The original gets changed too!\nprint(original_list)\nprint(copied_list)\n\n[99, 2, -5]\n[99, 2, -5]"

    "text": "Conditionals\nConditionals let you make decisions in your code with if, elif, and else statements. Often these use boolean comparators which evaluate a statement and return whether it is true or false. Python’s boolean comparators are\n\n\n\nBoolean comparator\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n==\nequal to\n\n\n\n\n# Create two variables and check whether one is greater than the other\na = 5\nb = 10\na &gt; b\n\nFalse\n\n\nBoolean comparators and conditional statements allow us to change the behavior of Python scripts depending on the values of certain variables. Conditional statements (like the if statement) have three parts: 1. The keyword 2. The test condition followed by a colon : 3. An indented codeblock that is executed if the test condition is True\nFor example:\n\ntemperature = 65                # a variable representing the temperature\n\nif temperature &gt; 70:            # The \"if\" keyword, the test condition, and a colon\n    print(\"It's warm outside\")  # An indented codeblock that runs if the test condition is True\n\nThe other conditional statements, else and elif (short for “else if”) use the same syntax as the if statement, but the must come after an if or elif statement. They can be used to execute different indented codeblocks under different circumstances.\nFor example:\n\ntemperature = 65  \n\nif temperature &gt; 70: \n    print(\"It's warm outside\")\nelif temperature &lt; 50:\n    print(\"It's cold outside\")\nelse:\n    print(\"It's a nice day\")\n\nIt's a nice day"

    "text": "Loops\nLoops let you repeat code. The for loop goes through each item in an iterable object, like a list:\n\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"]\n\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n\napple\nbanana\norange\n\n\nThe range() function creates an iterable sequence of numbers that can be used to control a for loop:\n\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\nThe while loop repeats as long as a condition is True.\n\ncount = 0\n\nwhile count &lt; 3:\n    print(f\"Count is {count}\")\n    count = count + 1\n\nCount is 0\nCount is 1\nCount is 2\n\n\nThe example above is not a great use of a while loop because the same thing can be accomplished with a for loop and while loops have the potential to run forever (or until you manually force the computer to stop). That’s called an “infinite loop” and can be a pain if triggered accidentally in your code. In the code above, if you left out the list line in the loop, for example, the value of count would never increase and the conditional test (count &lt; 3) would always be True and the loop would run forever.\nIt’s best to reserve while loops for situations where you’re uncertain how many iterations are needed."

If I plug a big value for \\(t\\) into the equation, it will probably show the terminal velocity. But I want to be able to check that, so I’ll calculate velocity for several values of \\(t\\) and confirm that the velocity stops changing (i.e., reaches it’s terminal value).\nSteps: * assign values to known parameters * use a for loop to calculate and print the velocity for several (maybe 10?) time values from 0 to 100.\n\n# Assign values to known parameters\ng = 9.81 # gravitational acceleration (m/s/s)\ne = 2.71828 # Euler's number\nm = 70 # parachutist's mass (kg)\nc = 12 # drag coefiecient (kg/s)\n\n# use a for loop to calculate and print the velocity for several (maybe 10?) \n# time values from 0 to 100.\nfor i in range(10):\n    t = 10*i # time in seconds\n    v = (g*m/c) * (1 - e**(-c*t/m))\n    print(f\"At time {t} sec, the velocity is {v:0.2f} m/s\")\n\nAt time 0 sec, the velocity is 0.00 m/s\nAt time 10 sec, the velocity is 46.92 m/s\nAt time 20 sec, the velocity is 55.37 m/s\nAt time 30 sec, the velocity is 56.89 m/s\nAt time 40 sec, the velocity is 57.16 m/s\nAt time 50 sec, the velocity is 57.21 m/s\nAt time 60 sec, the velocity is 57.22 m/s\nAt time 70 sec, the velocity is 57.22 m/s\nAt time 80 sec, the velocity is 57.22 m/s\nAt time 90 sec, the velocity is 57.22 m/s\n\n\n\nprint(f\"The terminal velocity is {v:0.2f} m/s\")\n\nThe terminal velocity is 57.22 m/s\n\n\nLooking back at your code and the resulting output, reflect on whether your code achieved the problem goal(s). To the extent the problem models a physical system, how realistic does the behavior seem? Are there any changes you would make to your approach if you were to solve this problem again (e.g., to make your code more re-usable or to avoid dead ends)?\nYes, the code achieves the problem goal. The behavior seems realistic because: * The sign of the velocity is the same as acceleration (falling downward). * After about 50 seconds, the velocity stays the same. * When the drag coefficient is small, the velocity increases linearly.\nI don’t know enough about parachuting to know if 57 m/s is a reasonable terminal velocity, but it sounds way too fast to be safe. A quick google search indicates a good landing speed for a parachute is around 7 m/s.\nIt would be nice if my code saved the velocity and time values so I could plot them. It would be hard to use this code to check the terminal velocity of several different combinations of mass and drag coefficient."

    "text": "Assignment repo: project_02\n\n\nDemonstrate the coding skills learned in the course to develop a notebook that could be useful for engineering professionals working on pile-driving projects.\n\n\n\nYour goal for Part 2 of the course project is to build a basic pile-driving app from a jupyter notebook. In this context, “app” doesn’t mean software that runs on a mobile device, it means software that someone could use to perform a particular task on a computer if they have access to your notebook and supporting Python scripts. The notebook itself should have minimal visible code. The majority of your code should live in one or more Python script files that are imported into the notebook. This helps separate the inner workings of the app from the user’s experience (and also helps prevent accidental changes to the code).\nThe app’s user should be able to:\n\nChoose a pile-driving log file from within the app’s file directory.\nSee a plot of the pile’s driving log data vs. elevation.\nSee a plot of the pile’s estimated capacity vs. elevation.\nSee a short text summary of the pile’s final condition, including:\n\nPile ID\nPile tip elevation\nPile load capacity\n\n\nThe purpose of the app and instructions for using it should be clearly described in the notebook. Any engineer who understands the basics of pile-driving and has a basic understanding of Jupyter notebooks should be able to use the notebook and understand its output.\nAdditionally, the supporting code should be well-documented with docstrings. Any individual who understands Python should be able to view the supporting code and understand how each function works by reading the docstrings. At a minimum, docstrings should include:\n\nA description of the function’s purpose.\nA list of the function’s input parameters, including whether they have default values and what units the should be in.\nA list of the function’s output parameters, including what units they will be in.\n\n\n\nThe way a user chooses a pile-driving log file can be as simple as typing the file name into the right place in a code cell in your notebook. Prompting the user for input or adding graphical user interface elements is not necessary.\nYour assignment repository will include a small number of properly formatted pile-driving logs for you to test your notebook with. You should assume that app users will want to add additional pile-driving logs and select them with your app. You may assume that any pile-driving logs the user adds will follow the same format as the sample logs.\n\n\n\nThe driving log data should show the blows per minute (BPM) and blows per foot (BPF) vs. pile tip elevation. The elevation should be shown on the vertical axis BPM and BPF can be included on a single plot or on two separate plots, but the elevations for both datasets should align visually. Since the elevation needs to be on the vertical axis, this means that if two plots are used, the two plots should be side-by-side.\n\n\n\nSimilar to the driving log data, the pile capacity should be plotted vs. pile tip elevation with elevation shown on the vertical axis.\nThe pile’s capacity should be estimated using the driving log and the \\(S_o\\) equation. The \\(S_o\\) equation provides a method of estimating capacity from the hammer energy and blow count. It is a simplification of the rational pile formula and is based on the impulse-momentum principles of the hammer/pile system.\nThe \\(S_o\\) equation is:\n\\[ Q = \\frac{a H W}{S + S_o}\\]\nWhere:\n\\[S_o = \\sqrt[]{\\frac{a H W L}{2 A E}} \\]\nAnd:\n\\(Q\\) = Ultimate pile capacity in pounds\n\\(H\\) = Height of hammer fall in feet\n\\(W\\) = weight of hammer in pounds\n\\(a\\) = Hammer efficiency\n\\(L\\) = Total pile length in feet\n\\(A\\) = Pile cross-sectional area in square inches\n\\(E\\) = Modulus of elasticity of pile material in pounds per square inch\n\\(S\\) = Pile penetration (in feet) per blow\nUse the following pile and hammer parameters for your app’s calculations:\n\n\n\nParameter\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\\(W\\)\n20,000 pounds\n\n\n\\(a\\)\n0.4\n\n\n\\(L\\)\n150 feet\n\n\n\\(A\\)\n477 square inches\n\n\n\\(E\\)\n6,000,000 psi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe text summary of the pile’s final condition should include the pile ID, final tip elevation, and final load capacity. An example is shown below (note - 1 “kip” = 1,000 pounds):\nPile ID: B-14\nPile tip elevation: -134 feet\nPile load capacity: 899 kips\n\n\n\n\nYour project will be submitted by pushing your work to GitHub (same as the homework submission procedure). At a minimum, the submission should include:\n\nYour app’s notebook (one .ipynb file)\nYour app’s support script (one or more .py files)\nAt least one of the pile-driving log data files (one or more .csv files)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour submission will be graded by the instructor with the following rubric:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nCriteria\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nData reading\nUsers have a way to change which pile-driving log is being analyzed by the app. The app will work for any properly formatted pile-driving log in the directory that the sample log files are in so that if a user adds additional logs, they can be analyzed by the app\n__ / 10\n\n\nApp instructions\nThe app instructions are clearly written such that an informed (i.e., familiar with pile-driving and Jupyter notebooks) user would be able to use the app.\n__ / 10\n\n\nPlots\nPlots of BPM, BPF, and pile load capacity are generated from the log.

The concepts are practiced through examples involving differential equations and programming with computational linear algebra.\n\n\n\nThis course is designed to enable students to meet the following learning objectives:\n\nCreate models of different kinds of systems (e.g., populations, thermal systems, mechanical systems) using multiple kinds of appropriate abstractions (e.g., free-body diagrams, differential equations), validate the predictions of models using different approaches (e.g., estimation, physical laws, analytical solutions), and use models to accomplish useful tasks (e.g., make predictions, explain behavior, evaluate design decisions).\nBe a critical consumer of models (e.g., by assessing a model you encounter and evaluating whether it is appropriate and useful for a given purpose).\nUse code-cased numerical tools to implement models, run simulations, work with data, and generate visualizations.\nCommunicate technical and quantitative information effectively using written and graphical media.\nWork effectively in teams to produce technical deliverables.\n\n\n\n\nUsing AI tools (which I’ll generically use to mean LLMs, generative models, coding agents, etc.) to help you generate code for homework assignments, in-class exercises, and projects is encouraged in this course. As a modeler and an engineer, you are responsible for all the work you submit. Which means that: - You should be able to explain each line of code you submit, whether you used AI on the submission or not. - If you cannot understand the code you submit, you are doing yourself a major disservice.\nIf used properly, AI tools can enhance your learning by allowing you to dig deeper into the physical significance of the models discussed in this course. If used without critically thinking about each line of code generated, AI tools can inhibit your learning by allowing you to complete assignments without understanding what it represents.\nUsing AI tools (or any internet resource, for that matter) is not allowed during in-class quizzes! This makes it all the more important to understand course concepts and not use AI to short-circuit your learning.\nIn short, AI is a tool. Use your tools wisely!\n\n\n\nThis course will have pre-recorded lectures and in-person instruction and exercises. Class sessions will involve a brief lecture recap followed by in-class exercises (ICEs) designed to help you with the weekly homework and/or project.\nI encourage you to work together with your classmates on the ICEs. We will have a quiz every two weeks in class on Thursday.\nOffice hours will be held immediately after class in the same room. I will stick around for an hour after the scheduled class time to help answer questions and work with you on assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will receive a homework assignment roughly every week. You should begin working on your assignment the day it is assigned. The description of the assignment will be posted on Canvas. Homework grades will be based on completeness and answers to reflection questions, rather than the correctness of your Python scripts. Homework should be your own work, but you may consult with classmates and use online resources to help. It is very important that you understand every line of code you submit.\n\n\n\nBiweekly on Thursday, we will have a quiz based on the most recently covered homework. Quiz dates are shown on the course schedule below. The lowest quiz score will be dropped at the end of the term.\nQuizzes are closed-book, closed-notes, individual activities. Consulting any external sources (internet, friend, etc.) is an academic integrity violation. Posting quiz materials or information to a website or sharing it with others is also a violation of academic integrity.\n\n\n\nThe course will culminate with a group project focused on implementing the numerical methods learned.\nEach team will submit a written report and include the source code for the project.\n\n\n\nPre-recorded lecture videos will be posted to Canvas as assignments. Additionally, occasional small assignments (e.g., surveys, low-stakes problems) may be assigned throughout the quarter.\n\n\n\n\nThe schedule below is preliminary and subject to change without notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nTuesday\nThursday\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n1\n–\nIntroductions, Engineering modeling concept (Ch. 1)\n\n\n\n2\nModeling framework\nProblem-solving\n\n\n\n3\nApproximation and error\nRoot finding Quiz 1\nProject Part 1 due\n\n\n4\nRoot finding\nRoot finding\n\n\n\n5\nMatrices\nMatrices Quiz 2\n\n\n\n6\nMatrices\nMatrices\nProject Part 2 due\n\n\n7\nSystems of equations\nSystems of equations Quiz 3\n\n\n\n8\nNo class (Veterans Day)\nNumerical differentiation\n\n\n\n9\nNumerical differentiation\nNumerical differentiation Quiz 4\n\n\n\n10\nNumerical integration\nNo class (Thanskgiving)\n\n\n\n11\nNumerical integration\n\n\n\n\nFinals week\nQuiz 5\n\nProject Part 3 due\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSO 1: an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics\nSO 6: an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions\n\n\n\nReligious Accommodations:- Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities.

    "text": "The course is designed to be run through GitHub Codespaces, which provides a web-based coding environment with everything you need pre-installed. For every assignment, when you accept the assignment in GitHub Classroom, a new GitHub repo will be created for you automatically. You can start a codespace for the assignment by clicking on the “Code” dropdown and selecting “Create codespace on main.” You should only need to do this once for each assignment.\nThis will launch a new codespace with the assignment files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt takes a few minutes for the codespace to get started and install all the requirements for the first time! Be patient - it’s essentially starting up a brand new computer from scratch. It will go faster the next time you open the codespace.\n\n\n\n\nAn un-graded “sandbox” assignment has been created so you can work on code independently of homework assignments if you’d like.\n\n\n\nThe codespaces run VS Code in a web browser. There are a few main areas you’ll want to navigate to use VS Code:\n\n\n\n\nPrimary sidebar: This area is set up to show the file explorer by default.\nActivity bar: The activity bar touches the primary sidebar and lets you select different content to show in the primary sidebar.\nSecondary sidebar: This area is set up to show the GitHub Copilot Chat. You can use this area to ask Copilot questions about your code.\nEditor: This is where your notebooks and scripts will open.\nPanel: This area sits beneath your editor and between the sidebars. This is where your Terminal and Jupyter Variables containers will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe positions of all the interface areas can be adjusted. Feel free to adjust them if you have a layout preference, but it can be a bit frustrating if you misplace something, so I recommend against it unless you’re familiar with VS Code and have a specific layout you prefer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way you submit your assignments with GitHub Classroom is by committing and pushing your changes. There are multiple ways to accomplish this, but I recommend using a few git commands in the terminal. The three commands are all you should need:\n\ngit add . This adds all the changes you’ve made to what will be committed.\ngit commit -m \"your message here\" This commits the changes in your codespaace and attaches a message to them. Of course, you can replace the text in the example with whatever message you want to include. In general, commit messages are supposed to be a brief description of the changes you made since the last commit.\ngit push This pushes your committed changes back to the repo.\n\nYou can create and push as many commits as you want. When grading, I’ll use whichever version existed at the time of the deadline unless you arrange something else with me. I recommend pushing your changes any time you’re planning to pause your work and close your codespace. The codespace should automatically save your changes and keep them, but it is possible to permanently lose changes if you delete the codespace (which is different than just closing the browser/tab) if they weren’t pushed to the repo.\n\n\n\nYour codespace includes the GitHub Copilot extension, which provides you with a powerful AI coding assistant. I encourage you to interact with Copilot and ask it questions about your code. It can write code for you based on instructions you provide and it can read your files to get additional context. In addition to experimenting with Copilot on your own, I encourage you to watch the Copilot videos listed on the Resources Page.\nRegardless of how you use copilot, you are responsible for all the code and text you submit.\n\n\nThere are some things Copilot can do that I’ve turned off on your codespaces. The features aren’t truly removed, just suppressed. They aren’t turned off to prevent you from using them, it’s more that I think they’re more likely to cause problems than be helpful.\nI’ve specifically configured Copilot to provide coding help based on where we’re at in the course. This is intended to prevent it from using Python language features we don’t cover in this class and may be difficult for you to interpret. If there are more advanced uses of Python you want to try, Copilot will help you with them if you ask it to “please override” the course’s coding assistance guidelines.\n\n\n\n\nThe codespace settings are all contained in the GitHub repos and you will have the ability to view, modify, and delete them. By default, I’ve set the codespace to hide these configuration files, but you’ll be able to see them in the repo. I’ve “hidden” them so that it’s difficult for you to accidentally break something about the codespace, not because I don’t want you to see them. If you have experience with the kinds of configuration files in the repo and you want to modify them, you may. But be warned: I can’t guarantee that I’ll be able to fix something if you break it and you’ll still be responsible for completing your assignments.",

Even if several days go by, getting some points is better than getting none! Of course, toward the end of the quarter, your flexibility runs out.\n\n\n\nHomework and Project assignments in Canvas will remain open for submissions after the deadline through the end of the quarter. I will grade late submissions like any other submission (except that it may take longer for me to get to them). Canvas will automatically deduct 10 percent of the possible grade for each day late up to 5 days. After 5 days, no further penalty is applied and Canvas will automatically deduct 50 percent of the possible grade from the graded assignment score. If there are unusual circumstances that you know about in advance, talk to me about them. For legitimate, pre-approved reasons, I can override Canvas’s deduction for late work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis late policy is based on the in-person, timed nature of the assignment type.\n\n\n\nQuizzes are conducted in-person in class.

    "text": "The course has different late policies depending on the assignment type.\n\n\n\n\nMy goal for this late policy is to motivate students to complete their work on time whenever possible, but still encourage completing assignments if the due date has passed. Even if several days go by, getting some points is better than getting none! Of course, toward the end of the quarter, your flexibility runs out.\n\n\n\nHomework and Project assignments in Canvas will remain open for submissions after the deadline through the end of the quarter. I will grade late submissions like any other submission (except that it may take longer for me to get to them). Canvas will automatically deduct 10 percent of the possible grade for each day late up to 5 days. After 5 days, no further penalty is applied and Canvas will automatically deduct 50 percent of the possible grade from the graded assignment score. If there are unusual circumstances that you know about in advance, talk to me about them. For legitimate, pre-approved reasons, I can override Canvas’s deduction for late work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis late policy is based on the in-person, timed nature of the assignment type.\n\n\n\nQuizzes are conducted in-person in class. In general, makeup quizzes will not be offered. If there are unusual circumstances that you know about in advance, talk to me about them. For legitimate, pre-approved reasons, I can allow you to arrange an alternative time to take a quiz. Course grade scale\nYour lowest quiz score for the quarter will be dropped.",

Today, we’ll cover some of the most commonly-used ones:\n\nint (numeric integers)\nfloat (numeric real numbers)\nbool (true or false)\nstring (text)\nlist (collection of other objects)\n\n\nint\nAn int is an integer value (e.g., 1 or -395). In Python, we can check the type of an object with the built-in type() function.\n\n# An integer\ntype(1)\n\n\n# Another integer\ntype(-395)\n\n\n\nfloat\nA float is another numeric data type in Python. Unlike an int, a float is a real number that can have several decimal places. For example:\n\n# A floating point number\ntype(9.81)\n\nNote that any number with a decimal place will be interpreted as a float by Python, even if there’s nothing after the decimal place:\n\n# This is also a floating point number\ntype(1.)\n\n\n\nbool\nA bool (boolean) represents True or False values. These are useful for yes/no questions.\n\n# In Python True and False are capitalized\ntype(True)\n\n\ntype(False)\n\n\n\nstr\nA string (or str) represents text. Strings are surrounded by quotes. Either single or double quotes can be used to surround strings:\n\n# A double-quoted string\ntype(\"hello\")\n\n\n# A single-quoted string\ntype('world')\n\nIt’s considered best practice to use double quotes for strings even though single quotes are accepted by Python. More importantly, whichever kind of quote starts the string has to be used to close it, or you’ll get a syntax error!\n\n# This will cause an error!\ntype('mismatch\")\n\n\n\nlist\nA list is a collection of other objects. Lists are surrounded by square brackets [] with their elements separated by commas.\n\n# A list of integers\ntype([1, 2, 3])\n\nThe elements of a list don’t need to be the same type.\n\n# A list of mixed types\ntype([1, \"two\", 3.0, True])\n\n\n# Even another list:\ntype([1, 2, [\"I'm\", \"a\", \"list\"], 4])"

    "text": "Numbers and Math\nMost arithmetic operations in Python act like you’d expect. For example:\n\n# Addition\nw = 20 + 34\nprint(w)\n\n\n# Subtraction\nx = 10 - 4\nprint(x)\n\n\n# Multiplication\ny = 3 * 7\nprint(y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThis is a good place to note one of the potential sources of error in Jupyter notebooks.\nNow that we’ve just overwritten the variable y with a new value, go back to the Variables section and run the cell that contains print(y). Python will always interpret variables based on their values at the time of execution, which may not reflect the expected values based on a linear reading of the notebook.\n\n\nDivision in Python will often look how you’d expect, but there are some details worth examining. The basic division operator is /, which works on int and float data types, but always returns a float. This is because it converts anything it’s operating on into a float before performing division. So, even if it’s used between two integers and the result could be represented as an integer, the resulting data type will be float.\n\n# Division\nz = 15 / 3\nprint(z) # z is a float even though 15 can be divided by 3 evenly\n\nTo perform integer division in Python, use the // operator. This performs division and returns the result rounded down to the next smallest whole number.\n\n# Returns an integer result (no rounding needed)\n15 // 3\n\n\n# This result gets rounded to the next smallest whole number\n13 // 3\n\nWhen you first learned to divide, you probably used “remainders” when numbers didn’t divide evenly. So the answer to 13 divided by 3 would have been 4 remainder 1. The integer division operator in Python ignores the remainder, but another useful operator provides it - the modulo operator: %.\n\n# The remainder after integer division\n13 % 3\n\nThe ** operator means “to the power of”. So 2 ** 3 means 2 to the power of 3.\n\n2 ** 3"

    "section": "Strings",
    "text": "Strings\nAlthough strings are text, not numbers, some of the operators discussed above can be used with strings. But, of course, they have different meanings when text is involved.\nFor example, “adding” two strings sticks the two pieces of text together:\n\n\"hello\" + \" world\"\n\nMultiplying a string creates multiple copies of the original text and sticks them all together:\n\n\" alright \" * 3\n\nOther operators (like - or /) don’t have unique meaning with strings, so they aren’t allowed. Trying to use them will result in an error:\n\n\"hello\" - \" world\"  # This will cause an error\n\nThe len() function returns the number of characters in a string:\n\nlen(\"This is a string. It's not super long, but it's long enough that I don't want to count the characters myself.\")\n\nOne of the most useful features Python has for strings is the “F-string”. With F-strings, you can put variables inside your strings (inside curly braces {}) and get the variable value inserted into your string.\n\ncourse = \"TME 310A\"\nstudents = 25\nmax_grade = 4.0\n\nprint(f\"There are {students} students registered for {course}. The highest grade you can get is {max_grade}\")\n\nStrings are indexed, which means that each character in the string has a numbered position (called an index). You can access the \\(n\\)th character in a string putting the index you want in square brackets after the string:\n\nmy_string = \"abstraction\"\nmy_string[2]\n\nDepending on what languages you’ve programmed in before, you may have expected my_string[2] to return b since that’s the 2nd character in the string. But Python is a “zero-indexed” language, so counting always starts at zero. To get the first character in the string, we need to put 0 in square brackets:\n\nmy_string[0]\n\nTrying to access an index past the end of the string will cause an error:\n\ntoo_far = len(my_string)\nmy_string[too_far] # This will cause an error\n\nNotice that the trying to access and index equal to the length of the string causes IndexError: string index out of range because the indexing starts at 0! That means that the last entry in the string will have the value len(my_string) - 1.\nIn fact, Python supports negative indexing without needing to find the length of the string. The last entry in the string has index -1; and the second to last entry has index -2, and so on.\n\nmy_string[-1] # This will give the last character of the string\n\n\nmy_string[-2] # This will give the second to last character of the string"

    "title": "Python Basics for Computational Physical Modeling",
    "section": "Lists",
    "text": "Lists\nWe’ve already seen that lists are containers that hold objects. Now we’ll discuss how to interact with these containers.\nLike strings, lists are indexed data types, so we can use the indexing syntax to access specific values in a list:\n\ncolors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]\n\n# Print the first item in the list:\nprint(colors[0])\n\nOne of the key differences between lists and strings is that lists are mutable, while strings are immutable. This means that you can change the value of an entry in a list, but you can’t with a string:\n\n# Change the second color from \"green\" to \"yellow\":\ncolors[1] = \"yellow\"\nprint(colors)\n\n\n# Trying to change one of the characters in a string will cause an error:\nmy_string[0] = \"A\" # This will cause an error\n\nCopying A major implication of whether an object is mutable or not is how Python handles copies of the object. We saw previously that when we made a copy of an integer variable, changing the original variable did not change the copy. This kind of copying is called deep copying. It’s the default behavior for immutable objects in Python so the same applies to strings:\n\n# Make a string and copy it\noriginal_string = \"TME 310A\"\ncopied_string = original_string\nprint(original_string)\nprint(copied_string)\n\n\n# Change the original string\noriginal_string = \"TME 310B\"\n\n# The copy is unchanged\nprint(original_string)\nprint(copied_string)\n\nBut since lists are mutable, when they’re copied, Python makes what’s called a shallow copy. A shallow copy points to the original rather than reproducing it. This means that a change to the original will immediately cause a change in the “copy”. And, strangely enough, a change in the copy will immediately change the original!\n\n# Make a list and copy it\noriginal_list = [ 1, 2, 3 ]\ncopied_list = original_list\nprint(original_list)\nprint(copied_list)\n\n\n# Change the original list\noriginal_list[0] = 99\n\n# Both the original and the \"copy\" are changed!\nprint(original_list)\nprint(copied_list)\n\n\n# Change the copy\ncopied_list[-1] = -5\n\n# The original gets changed too!\nprint(original_list)\nprint(copied_list)"

Conditional statements (like the if statement) have three parts: 1. The keyword 2. The test condition followed by a colon : 3. An indented codeblock that is executed if the test condition is True\nFor example:\n\ntemperature = 65                # a variable representing the temperature\n\nif temperature &gt; 70:            # The \"if\" keyword, the test condition, and a colon\n    print(\"It's warm outside\")  # An indented codeblock that runs if the test condition is True\n\nThe other conditional statements, else and elif (short for “else if”) use the same syntax as the if statement, but the must come after an if or elif statement. They can be used to execute different indented codeblocks under different circumstances.\nFor example:\n\ntemperature = 65  \n\nif temperature &gt; 70: \n    print(\"It's warm outside\")\nelif temperature &lt; 50:\n    print(\"It's cold outside\")\nelse:\n    print(\"It's a nice day\")"

That’s called an “infinite loop” and can be a pain if triggered accidentally in your code. In the code above, if you left out the list line in the loop, for example, the value of count would never increase and the conditional test (count &lt; 3) would always be True and the loop would run forever.\nIt’s best to reserve while loops for situations where you’re uncertain how many iterations are needed."

That might look something like this:\na = input(\"Enter a positive number: \")\nsqrt_approx(a, tol=1e-6)\nWhile there’s nothing wrong with this approach in terms of solving the stated problem, it does create a serious limitation on the usability of your code. The main advantage of using computers is that they can perform calculations millions of times faster than humans. When we put hard stops in our code that have to wait for a human user to type something in, we’re doing two things: (1) allowing user control over what’s being calculated and (2) bringing the calculations to a screeching halt. In general, allowing user control is good and pausing the computer’s work is not so good.\nOf course, you’re unlikely to need to re-use your square root approximation since that particular calculation can be done without writing your own function for it. But I encourage everyone to adopt the practice of thinking about re-usability (that’s why it’s built in to so many of the reflection prompts). However, I don’t want anyone to get carried away with the idea of maximizing re-usability. For now, getting the core functionality of our work into… well, functions… is a great place to focus."

    "text": "Testing your code\nA few solutions explicitly included tests that checked whether the code produced the expected output for several input values. This is a great practice and will help make your code more robust by showing you mistakes when you’re looking for them (rather than when you’re trying to use your code to accomplish something else). I’m sure several students tested their code manually and confirmed that it was working as intended. Manual checking is also a good practice and it’s perfectly fine for your homework assignments. Formal software testing is out of scope for this class, but it’s still a good idea to run your functions through a few loops of parameters to confirm it’s working how you think it’s working. Plotting the results is a great way to review your code’s behavior. For example, if given input values (\\(x\\)) ranging from -10 to 10, I would expect a plot of the square root approximation results (\\(y\\)) from Problem 2 (without any modifications or improvements) to look like a straight line, \\(y=0\\), up to a \\(x\\) value of zero and to have a concave downward curve with a very steep slope near \\(x=0\\) and a shallow slope for large values of \\(x\\).

The plot on the right is zoomed in and also shows the expected output from the algorithm.\nClearly, there is something wrong with the implementation of the square root approximation. But it’s also clear that there are some places where doing a spot check would return an answer very close to the expected value. This is a case where spot checking two or three values (between \\(x=2\\) and \\(x=4\\)) would give a false sense of confidence in the code."

    "section": "Alternative approach: recursion",
    "text": "Alternative approach: recursion\nA few students asked about alternative methods to solving the square root approximation problem from Homework 3. The flowchart that presented the algorithm seemed to use something like a while True: style loop that needed to be broken with an internal if &lt;condition&gt;: statement with a break statement inside it. Several students combined these approaches to use a while &lt;condition&gt;: statement (where the “condition” being checked would be opposite of the one from the flowchart). Both of these work, and the second is probably easier to read.\nAnother option for this kind of problem is to use a recursive function. A function is recursive if it calls itself at some point during its execution with the right input parameters. For a function seeking an approximation within a set tolerance, a recursive solution would involve making one approximation, checking the tolerance and returning the solution if the tolerance is met and calling itself if the tolerance is not met. These recursive calls will continue until the tolerance is met, at which point, the solution is returned (through a chain of repeated calls to the function).\nThe recursive version of the problem is implemented twice below. The first version is just the plain code needed to implement the algorithm. The second version is verbose (i.e., it spits out text describing what it’s doing). It includes print statements describing what’s being done at each recursion level.\n\nPlain code version\n\ndef step_approximation(a, x, tol, error=1):\n    y = (x + a / x) / 2\n    error = abs((y - x) / y)\n    if error &lt; tol:\n        return y\n    else:\n        return step_approximation(a, y, tol, error)\n\n\ndef sqrt_approx(a, tol=1e-5):\n    if a &gt; 0:\n        return step_approximation(a, a / 2, tol)\n    else:\n        return 0\n\nsqrt_approx(100, tol=1e-6)\n\n10.0\n\n\n\n\nVerbose version\nIn this version, print statements have been added that keep track of the recursion depth. A depth of 0 means it’s the first call to the function (from within sqrt_approx()). Depths of 1 and greater are recursive calls from within step_approximation().\nAs you can see from the output, when finding the square root of 100 to a tolerance of 1e-6, there is one original call, followed by six recursive calls to step_approximation(). On the sixth recursive call, the error is within the specified tolerance, so a result is returned instead of making another recursive call. Since all the calls to step_approximation() are expecting a result, all of the recursive calls are waiting for something to get returned. When this eventually happens, the result gets passed back “up” the recursive chain and back out to sqrt_approx(), which accepts it without knowing or caring how it was calculated.\n\ndef step_approximation(a, x, tol, error=1, depth=0):\n    y = (x + a / x) / 2\n    error = abs((y - x) / y)\n    print(\n        f\"{'  '*depth}{depth}: Between approximations for sqrt({a}) of {x:.9f} and {y:.9f}, the error is {error:.11f}.\"\n    )\n    if error &lt; tol:\n        print(f\"{'  ' * depth}{depth}: That's close enough!

    "text": "Goode use of AI-generated code\nI saw a lot of good examples of people using AI-generated code! There were two main flavors of answers from AI-generated code for Problem 1: concise or verbose. Concise versions generally looked something like this:\ndef get_pendulum_data(data_file):\n    with open(data_file, 'r') as f:\n        first_line = f.readline().strip()\n    dt = float(first_line.split(':')[1].split()[0])\n    data = np.loadtxt(data_file, delimiter=',', skiprows=3)\n    x = data[:,0]\n    y = data[:,1]\n\n    return dt, x, y\nThis code is easy to read and doesn’t do anything too fancy.\nMore verbose AI-generated code solutions looked like this:\ndef get_pendulum_data(data_file):\n    \"\"\"Read pendulum CSV file and return (dt, x, y).\"\"\"\n    with open(data_file, 'r') as f:\n        lines = f.read().splitlines()\n\n    dt = None\n    for ln in lines[:5]: \n        s = ln.strip()\n        if not s:\n            continue\n        m = re.search(r'[-+]?[0-9]*\\.?[0-9]+(?:[eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?', s)\n        if m:\n            try:\n                dt = float(m.group(0))\n                break\n            except ValueError:\n                pass\n    if dt is None:\n        raise ValueError('Could not parse dt from file header')\n\n    data_start = None\n    for i, ln in enumerate(lines):\n        s = ln.strip()\n        if not s:\n            continue\n        parts = [p.strip() for p in s.split(',') if p.strip()!='']\n        if len(parts) &gt;= 2:\n            try:\n                _ = float(re.search(r'[-+]?[0-9]*\\.?[0-9]+(?:[eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?', parts[0]).group(0))\n                _ = float(re.search(r'[-+]?[0-9]*\\.?[0-9]+(?:[eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?', parts[1]).group(0))\n                data_start = i\n                break\n            except Exception:\n                continue\n    if data_start is None:\n        raise ValueError('Could not find numeric data in file')\n\n    data_text = '\\n'.join(lines[data_start:])\n    xy_data = np.loadtxt(io.StringIO(data_text), delimiter=',')\n    x = xy_data[:, 0]\n    y = xy_data[:, 1]\n\n    return dt, x, y\nThere’s nothing wrong with the verbose version, but it’s certainly harder to read. And most of what it’s doing is evaluating the format of the csv file to see what’s in there. A lot of students noted that their simple solutions to extracting the data limit what kind of file structures could be opened with it. That’s a great point! The cost of trying to generalize is much longer code.\nEven though I don’t prefer the verbose code, there were some excellent submissions that used it. For example, I saw some students who had verbose code, but explained in their reflections how they checked to make sure what the function returned was what they wanted. That’s great approach!\nAn even better approach that some took is to get copilot to do better. By breaking down the problem and asking copilot to complete smaller sized tasks, some students were able to get something much more readable than the verbose code.\nI’d be interested to know what people used for their prompts!"

    "text": "Right answers for the wrong reasons\nI think everyone who had an answer for the bonus problem came to the right conclusion (the data were recorded in different units) but for the wrong reasons. The approaches all had some merit, but made assumptions that would have concluded that the data were in different units even if they weren’t. Setting the bonus problem itself aside for a moment, the idea of getting the right answer for the wrong reasons is worth thinking about.\nThe danger with getting the right answer for the wrong reasons is that it gives a false sense of confidence in our solution. This may lead us to re-use the solution in another situation where the wrong reasoning (that we’re unaware of) gives us a wrong answer that we assume is right.\nThe only way to truly avoid this is to conduct rigorous testing that challenges all of our assumptions and shows their limitations. We won’t get into formal software testing in this course. And it’s often not practical to challenge every single assumption we make, even if we know how to do that.\nSo how to balance the need to check our assumptions with the impracticality of writing exhaustive tests for every problem we solve? It will probably not be a surprise that I think asking Copilot provides a good balance here. Copilot won’t catch every mistake you make in your assumptions, but it does provide the “second set of eyes” that are often critical to spotting the errors we’re blind to.\nIn my work, I use prompts like this:\n\nCheck the assumptions in my approach\nIs my approach likely to lead to the right solution?\nWill my approach lead to false positives? false negatives?\n\nI suggest that you try these kinds of prompts to see what you get. Try asking the question a few different ways, too. As a point of reference, I asked Copilot similar questions about several of the right-answer-wrong-reason submissions for the Bonus problem and it was able to identify the incorrect assumptions and modify them to better represent the problem."
